# Ordo

**Ordo** is a noun in Latin meaning *a methodical series, arrangement, or order*.
That is also what this simple web app is going to do: methodically identify your
preference over a bunch of items that you're having a decidophobia session upon.
Which ones should you buy? Are you paying too much for the coat? How come these
two skirts look exactly the sameðŸ¤¯?

If you're curious (or have been looking at your shopping cart for a few hours),
feel free to go to the next tab and give it a try. There's nothing to lose except
some ridiculously priced items from your fuss.
